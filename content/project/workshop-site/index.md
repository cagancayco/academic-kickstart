**UVa School of Medicine Research Computing (SOMRC)**

SOMRC offers workshops to the UVa community to help researchers learn basic programming techniques. To reach a broader audience, SOMRC created an online repository for all our workshop materials: [https://workshops.somrc.virginia.edu](https://workshops.somrc.virginia.edu).

The website is built with R Blogdown and hosted in S3, with Travis CI for CI/CD. My specific contributions to this project are Markdown pages and Jupyter Notebooksfor various workshops, including:

* [**Introduction to Python**](https://workshops.somrc.virginia.edu/lesson/python-intro/) ([.md](https://github.com/uvasomrc/workshop-site/blob/master/content/lesson/python-intro.md)|[.ipynb](https://github.com/uvasomrc/intro-python/blob/master/Intro_Python.ipynb))

* [**Data Manipulation with Python**](https://workshops.somrc.virginia.edu/lesson/python-data-manip/) ([.md](https://github.com/uvasomrc/workshop-site/blob/master/content/lesson/python-data-manip.md)|[.ipynb](https://github.com/uvasomrc/python-data-manip/blob/master/Data_Manip_Python.ipynb))

* [**MATLAB Fundamentals**](https://workshops.somrc.virginia.edu/lesson/matlab-fundamentals/) ([.md](https://github.com/uvasomrc/workshop-site/blob/master/content/lesson/matlab-fundamentals.md))

* [**Image Data Management with OMERO**](https://workshops.somrc.virginia.edu/lesson/omero/) ([.md](https://github.com/uvasomrc/workshop-site/blob/master/content/lesson/omero.md))
