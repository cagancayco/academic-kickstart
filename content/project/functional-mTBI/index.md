A reported 1.7 million people experience traumatic brain injury (TBI) each year<sup>1</sup>. After a concussion, athletes are cleared to return to play after 7 to 10 days<sup>2</sup>, while non-athletes are typically expected to recover within 3 to 6 months<sup>3,4,5</sup>. Researchers were interested in investigating whether disruptions in functional activity and connectivity persist beyond the clinical recovery period.

This was the undergraduate thesis project of a student I mentored in the UVa Functional Neuroradiology Lab. In addition to teaching her how to write bash scripts for using UVa's HPC system, I performed machine learning analyses in MATLAB using the Pronto toolbox for classifying functional brain activity.
