**Principal Investigator: Dr. Paula Barrett, UVa Dept. of Pharmacology**

Calcium oscillations signify communication between zona glomerulosa cells of the mouse adrenal gland. Researchers in the Barrett Lab can capture these oscillatory events with calcium imaging, but they had difficulty analyzing the results. The Barrett Lab was in need of a comprehensive MATLAB program for quantitative analysis of the intracellular calcium signals from their cell imaging experiments. Prior to my involvement in the project, the Barrett Lab had been using fragments of code to analyze their data with little success. I developed a MATLAB application to create an efficient, centralized workflow that is also accessible to people who are new to MATLAB and programming.

With this application, the Barrett Lab was able to analyze the characteristics of calcium oscillatory events for the first time in two years. The app allows researchers to:

* Choose data and analysis parameters

* View full or partial fluorescent reading traces

* Perform quantitative analysis of individual events and bursts of events
